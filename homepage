        <h4>The Story Thus Far...</h4>
        <p>Our story begins in the small city of Whitefrost. In the distance, a church bell tolls as our heroes 
            walk the busy and narrow streets of a fishing market. A light fog hovers above the stream that 
            runs through the town. A local fisherman warns newcommers not to stay out past dark. By three chimes, the sun
        begins to set as small yellowish lights flicker on in the windows of homes. The streets clear out and the only thing left is the smell of fish.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a>"DC 15 (History): Whitefrost is a small settlement mostly comprised of fishermen and whalers. It is one of the few human settlements in Ruach, the northernmost island in the far north. It was originally made by the Norsemen of Jorn, but the fishing business attracted many people from all over. It is an independent town that is known for its maximum security prison, The Iron Keep."</a></li>
                 <li><a>"DC 20 (History): The Iron Keep is run by an independent company known as The Ungoliant. Shipments arrive from all over bearing prisoners to be kept at the fortress. An interesting fact is that the fortress is much older than The Ungoliant and the town of Whitefrost, being discovered by the early settlers. No one knows what it was used for or who built it. What puzzles historians most is the maze-like design of the place. The underground levels of the fortress are actually a series of secret network of tunnels and passages. "</a></li>

<header>The Glass Forest</header>

<img src="Glass Forest.jpg" style="width:100%;height:100%;">

<h4>The Story Thus Far...</h4>
<p>Making way towards Winterhaven, our heroes choose which road to take. The safe road that bends easterly? Or the dangerous (although much quicker) path through the Glass Forest.
    The edge of the forest stretches out loomingly towards our heroes as the shadows stretch out, bending and waning with the setting sun.
    It's getting dark and soon, a lone wolf is spotted dancing between the moonlit trees. It's almost completely dark as the clouds cover the moon 
    and a scream can be heard just beyond the light of the campfire.
